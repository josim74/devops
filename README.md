## Structure

## Instruction Style
I am using a concise step-by-step format for instructions. Example:

### Create an EC2 Instance in AWS
```
EC2 > Launch Instance
    Name: my-instance
    Instance Type: t2.micro
    Key Pair: my-key.pem (existing key)
    Security Group:
        <x> Select existing security group
        <Select> my_ec2_sg
> Launch Instance
```

Explore each subdirectory for detailed topic-wise guides.
